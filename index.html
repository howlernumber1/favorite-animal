    <h1>The German Shepherd</h1>
    <img src="german-shepherd.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds — for good reason. He’s an intelligent and
        capable working dog. His devotion and courage are unmatched. And he’s amazingly versatile, excelling at most
        anything he’s trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service,
        herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience and, last but not least, faithful companion.</p>
